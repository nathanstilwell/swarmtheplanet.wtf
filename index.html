    Looking forward to our impending rebrand and gaining a deeper connection to community on a global scale, our theme is "Swarm the Planet". The Swarm is an homage to to the natural truth that the whole is made of many parts. Mass is a collection of atoms; a network a collection of clients; a community a collection of individuals.

    There are a ever increasing number of ways to "connect" and the surface area of a product is ever expanding. The Internet of Things will be made up of phones, laptops, tablets, watches, arduinos, rasberries, beagle bones, and countless microcontrollers on your clothes under your skin. The web will move from a screen to become the world around you. This path could pull us apart and keep us in silos of distraction. But some of us feel like this could also free us up to be less distracted and focus on finding more meaningful ways to be together.

    After a generation at a desk behind a screen, we are ready to go out in the sun and be connected in the world. The web now goes with us in our pockets. But that web needs to be more full-featured and resilient to where life takes us. It needs to adapt to various network conditions and capabilities. It needs to be aware of the physical world around it. It needs to accessible to its users and speak many languages.
