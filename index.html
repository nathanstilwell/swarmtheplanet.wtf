    The Swarm is an homage to the natural truth that the whole is made up of many parts. Mass is a collection of atoms; a network is a collection of clients; a community is a collection of individuals. Embrace these definitions as you consider your Hackathon project.
  </p>

  <p class="copy mx4 f5">
    The Swarm is human. We acknowledge human and cultural diversity. We embrace the challenges which come with our efforts to connect people to the things they want to do in the lives they want to lead.
  </p>

  <p class="copy mx4 f5">
    The Swarm is technological. There are an ever increasing number of ways to "connect" and the surface area of a product is ever expanding. The Internet of Things will be made up of phones, laptops, tablets, watches, arduinos, raspberries, beagle bones, and countless microcontrollers on your clothes under your skin. The web will move from a screen to become the world around you. This path could pull us apart and keep us in silos of distraction. But some of us feel like this could also free us up to be less distracted and focus on finding more meaningful ways to be together.
  </p>

  <p class="copy mx4 f5">
    The Swarm is offline. Following the generation at the desk behind the screen, we are ready to go out in the sun and be connected in the world. The web now comes with us in our pockets. But that web needs to be more full-featured and resilient to where life takes us. It needs to adapt to various network conditions and capabilities. It needs to be aware of the physical world around it. It needs to be accessible to its users and speak the many languages of the world.

  <p class="copy mx4 f5">
    The Swarm is a people. There are many different roles to play, jobs to fill, notes to sing in the chorus. <q cite="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/o-me-o-life">That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.</q> When we contribute in harmony, all things are fulfilled.
